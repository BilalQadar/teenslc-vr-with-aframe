        ##Teens Learning Code: VR with A-Frame
        <br>

        #Schedule

        **Intro to VR (45 min):** Coders' Code, What is Code, Today's Project, What is VR + AR, Why create VR, What is WebVR.

        **Intro + Code Along in A-Frame (time):** Exploring examples, Primitives, Creating an account, Setting up Glitch, Code Along challenges + Sharing solutions. <!-- i am here--> 

        **Name (time):**

        <br>
        #Materials + Special Requirements

        * Learners will need an email address to create a free Glitch account.
        * Google (or other brand) VR Cardboard viewers

        <br>
        #Contingency

        If you do not have access to the internet, use the following modifications:

        * Copy over learner files onto all computers (link on Welcome slide).
        * Ensure that [Atom](http://atom.io) is installed on all computers.
        * Have learners add the `offline-starter-code` project folder in Atom.
        * Learners can preview their project by opening the starter code `index.html` in their browser.
        * Use the images in the `assets` folder as textures.
        * Skip working with the Registry (slides 33-37).
        * Spend more time sharing projects. Have learners bring their laptops to the front to share on the projector.
        * If possible, install a few VR apps on phones for the VR Cardboard section. [Here are some recommended VR apps](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_Uo_07zebpE7xwZWkCsECMCbnfwh3N57JqCZGwnDPmo/edit?usp=sharing).
        * Please remind learners to save often!

        #Notes:

        **Introductions (Slide 3):**
        Have mentors stand up and introduce themselves with their name and pronouns.

        Have learners introduce themselves to their table groups and answer an icebreaker question, e.g. "If you could travel anywhere in the world, where would you want to go?"

        **Today's Project (Slide 9):**
        This is an example of what we could make (virtual ice cream cone!). Learners can create this or whatever virtual world they can imagine.

        **VR (slide 11) &amp; AR (slide 12):** Show the examples linked.

        **Think, Pair, Share: Why Create Virtual Experiences? (Slide 13):** Give learners time to think and write down ideas before sharing with 1-2 other people. Use a timer like [timer-tab.com](http://timer-tab.com) to time 2 minutes. Once the time is up, have a few people share their ideas with the entire group.

        **Some Considerations (Slide 14):** Discuss these potential downsides to VR. Has anyone experienced motino sickness from VR? How affordable are most VR systems or games? Any other considerations to keep in mind?

        **Intro to A-Frame (slide 18):** Give learners 5 minutes to explore the example projects. Use the WASD or arrow keys + mouse to navigate.

        **Getting Started (slide 20):** Learners will need an email address to create a (free) account.

        In the case where participants don't have an email address and aren't comfortable creating one, Glitch will save a cached version of their website in their browser, but only temporarily. They will not be able to save or view their website later unless they create an account and log in.

        Optional login info for instructors:<br>
        *Username:* teenslc-toronto<br>
        *Password:* Helloteens123

        **Setting up Glitch (slide 22):** This is optional, but will make the learners' lives easier as they develop their websites. It removes the step of having to click between tabs and scroll within their code editor.

        **Edit the Code (slide 23):** Learners should have some experience with HTML &amp; CSS (as a prerequisite). Some of these HTML elements and formatting should look familiar.

        **Challenge (slide 24):** Give learners 15-20 minutes to tinker with the starter code and complete as many of these challenges as they can.

        Have volunteer learners come up to the front to share their solutions.

        **Assets (slide 25):** It might take some time for learners to decide on and download assets. To save time, instruct learners to download ONE background images and ONE texture to start. They can always download more later.

        Learners can also use the ice cream texture images found in the learner files.

        **Adding Audio (slide 30-31):** Note that audio can be a bit tricky. It doesn't always work when viewing on mobile (e.g. when we use the VR Cardboard).

        **Experience your Virtual World! (slide 43):** Give learners time to set up and experience their own projects using VR Cardboard before sharing with others. If loaner phones aren't available, learners and mentors can connect to the internet on their own mobile devices (whoever has them and is comfortable).

        **DEMOS:** Have learners set up their projects on the VR Cardboard viewers as stations in the classroom and provide 15-20 minutes for learners to experience each other's virtual worlds.

        **Next Steps:** Treat the Take-Home Exercise as a stretch goal if you have any time remaining.
