        ##Teens Learning Code: VR with A-Frame
        <br>

        #Schedule

        **Intro to VR (45 min):** Coders' Code, What is Code, Today's Project, What is VR + AR, Why create VR, What is WebVR, Artist Profile.

        **Intro + Code Along in A-Frame (1 hour):** Exploring examples, Primitives, Creating an account, Setting up Glitch, Code Along challenges + Sharing solutions.

        **Building + Customizing our Virtual Spaces (1 hour):** Finding + saving assets, Asset management system, Adding backgrounds, primitives, and textures.

        **Lunch (1 hour):** Usually lunch is scheduled around 12:30/45, but sometimes the food arrives later. Break whenever you need to - You can just continue where you left off.

        **Adding Interactivity (30 min):** Animating on events, Finding + saving audio, Adding audio.

        **Special Effects (1 hour 15 min):** A-Frame Regitry, Adding components, Inspecting the scene, Testing + applying changes, Work session - experimenting with components.

        **DEMOS + Closing (30 min)** Save and share projects, set up VR viewer stations, Rotate through and explore projects, Next steps, Learning outcomes, Wrap-up.

        <br>
        #Materials + Special Requirements

        * Learners will need an email address to create a free Glitch account.
        * Google Cardboard or other VR viewers (5-6 to set up stations for the DEMOS)

        <br>
        #Contingency

        If you do not have access to the internet, use the following modifications:

        * Copy over learner files onto all computers (link on Welcome slide).
        * Ensure that [Atom](http://atom.io) is installed on all computers.
        * Have learners add the `offline-starter-code` project folder in Atom.
        * Learners can preview their project by opening the starter code `index.html` in their browser.
        * Use the images in the `assets` folder as textures.
        * Unzip the `aframe-documentation` folder and reference this instead of the online documentation.
        * Skip working with the Registry.
        * Spend more time sharing projects. Have learners bring their laptops to the front to share on the projector.
        * If possible, install a few VR apps on phones for the VR Viewers section. [Here are some recommended VR apps](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_Uo_07zebpE7xwZWkCsECMCbnfwh3N57JqCZGwnDPmo/edit?usp=sharing).
        * Please remind learners to save often!

        #Notes:

        **Introductions (Slide 3):**
        Have mentors stand up and introduce themselves with their name and pronouns.

        Have learners introduce themselves to their table groups and answer an icebreaker question, for example: "If you could travel anywhere in the world, where would you want to go?"

        **Today's Project (Slide 9):**
        This is an example of what we could make (virtual ice cream cone!). Learners can create this or whatever virtual world they can imagine.

        **VR (slide 11) &amp; AR (slide 12):** Show each of the examples linked.

        **Think, Pair, Share: Why Create Virtual Experiences? (Slide 13):** Give learners time to think and write down ideas before sharing with 1-2 other people. Use a timer like [timer-tab.com](http://timer-tab.com) to time 2 minutes. Once the time is up, have a few people share their ideas with the entire class.

        **Some Considerations (Slide 14):** Discuss these potential downsides to VR. Has anyone experienced motino sickness from VR? How affordable are most VR systems or games? Any other considerations to keep in mind?

        **Artist Profile (slide 17-18):** Share an example artist (Scott) that uses VR to create immersive experiences. Watch the video clip of his example - keeping in mind that this is just a recording of the project, not the actual VR experience.

        Ask learners: What stood out? What do you think is going on in this piece? (Here's a video of Scott explaining what it is about: [https://vimeo.com/247365954](https://vimeo.com/247365954))

        **Intro to A-Frame (slide 20):** Direct learners to the aframe.io website and give them 5-10 minutes to explore the example projects. Use the WASD or arrow keys + mouse to navigate.

        **Getting Started (slide 22):** Learners will need an email address to create a (free) account.

        In the case where participants don't have an email address and aren't comfortable creating one, Glitch will save a cached version of their website in their browser, but only temporarily. They will not be able to save or view their website later unless they create an account and log in.

        Optional login info for instructors:<br>
        *Username:* teenslc-toronto<br>
        *Password:* Helloteens123

        **Setting up Glitch (slide 24):** This is optional, but will make the learners' lives easier as they develop their websites. It removes the step of having to click between tabs and scroll within their code editor.

        **Edit the Code (slide 25):** Learners should have some experience with HTML &amp; CSS (as a prerequisite). Some of these HTML elements and formatting should look familiar.

        **Challenge (slide 26):** Give learners 15-20 minutes to tinker with the starter code and complete as many of these challenges as they can.

        Have volunteer learners come up to the front to share their solutions.

        **Assets (slide 29):** It might take some time for learners to decide on and download assets. To save time, instruct learners to download ONE background images and ONE texture to start. They can always download more later.

        Learners can also use the ice cream texture images found in the learner files.

        **Adding Audio (slide 39-40):** Note that audio can be a bit tricky. It doesn't always work when viewing on mobile (e.g. when we use the VR Viewers). - Just to set expectations appropriately when we pull out the VR viewers.

        **More Registry Options (slide 47):** Walk learners through adding `id`s to name their primitives (see Tip).

        **Work Session (slide 48)**: Learners can choose which components they want to experiment with. The more the better! Ideally, after this work session, projects will look even more unique, and there will be some variety in DEMOS when we share projects with each other.

        Leave this slide up and walk around the classroom to support, as needed. You may also need to demonstrate an additional component example if the class is having trouble working with the registry.

        **Experience your Virtual World! (slide 50):** Give learners time to set up and experience their own projects using VR Viewers before sharing with others. Mentors can each 'own' a viewer to help with sharing them equally. If loaner phones aren't available, learners and mentors can connect to the internet on their own mobile devices (whoever has them and is comfortable).

        **DEMOS (slide 51):** Have learners set up their projects on the VR Viewers viewers as stations in the classroom and provide 15-20 minutes for learners to experience each other's virtual worlds.

        **Next Steps (slide 52):** Treat the Take-Home Exercise as a stretch goal if you have any time remaining.
